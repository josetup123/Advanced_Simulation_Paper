We use administrative data on firefighting expenditures to measure the causal effect of nearby homes on the amount spent to extinguish wildfires. We use these estimates in an actuarial calculation yielding geographically differentiated expected implicit subsidies for homes across the western United States. The expected net present value of this subsidy can exceed 20 percent of home value, increases with fire hazard, and decreases surprisingly steeply with development density. We discuss potential behavioral responses by individuals and local governments using a simple economic model.},

Current wildland fire management models may not reliably do so. The problem of identifying the most efficient wildland fire organization is characterized mathematically using integer-programming techniques. This mathematical exposition is then solved using the {LINGO} optimization language. Sensitivity analysis is conducted on model inputs to demonstrate the flexibility of the model architecture. Further, the model is used to model budget constraints commonly faced by fire managers. {FOR}. {SCI}. 49(2):331–335.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a distributed deep reinforcement learning ({RL}) based strategy for a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ({UAVs}) to autonomously fight forest fires. We first model the forest fire as a Markov decision process ({MDP}) with a factored structure. We consider optimally controlling the forest fire without agents using dynamic programming, and show any exact solution and many approximate solutions are computationally intractable. Given the problem complexity, we consider a deep {RL} approach in which each agent learns a policy requiring only local information. We show with Monte Carlo simulations that the deep {RL} policy outperforms a hand-tuned heuristic, and scales well for various forest sizes and different numbers of {UAVs} as well as variations in model parameters. Experimental demonstrations with mobile robots fighting a simulated forest fire in the Robotarium at the Georgia Institute of Technology are also presented.},
