Initially, satellite imaging is employed from three sourcesâ€”Landsat, MODIS, and VIIRS. Each dataset is standardized, offering a confidence level for the likelihood of a fire event at each represented heat point in the future. This data is presented in tabular format and forms the basis for the backend, comprising a Django-based API and a containerized MySQL platform. The API operates as a RESTful interface for socket communication and serves as an executor of operations within the inner backend. Real-time traffic information is sourced from TomTom live data, communicating with the OSRM routing engine to generate a realistic cost matrix for transportation in optimizing neighboring station placement. Following optimization, the results are visualized in the AnyLogic GUI. The second stage involves a reinforcement learning-based policy aiming to select the policy that minimizes the economic impact caused by a fire event. An advantage actor-critic is utilized to train independent clusters for each agent, empowering them to decide on the necessary containment actions for fire events. }}{4}{}\protected@file@percent }
