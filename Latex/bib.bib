	doi = {10.1109/SMC.2013.112},
	abstract = {This work formulates for the first time a multiple traveling salesman problem (MTSP) with ordinary and exclusive cities, denoted by MTSP for short. In the original MTSP, a city can be visited by any traveling salesman and is thus renamed as an ordinary one in MTSP. A new class of cities is introduced in MTSP, called exclusive ones. They are divided into groups, each of which can be exclusively visited by a specified or predetermined salesman. To solve MTSP, a genetic algorithm is presented. It encodes cities and salesman into two single chromosomes. Accordingly, three modes of crossover and mutation operators are designed, i.e., simple city crossover and mutation (CCM), simple salesman crossover and mutation, and mixed city-salesman crossover and mutation. All the operations of crossover and mutation follow the proper relationship between cities and salesman. With the help of an MTSP example, the performance of the proposed algorithm with three modes of crossover and mutation operators is compared and analyzed. The simulation results show that the algorithm can solve MTSP with rapid convergence with CCM being the best mode of the operators.},

The optimization task can be described as follows: given a fleet of vehicles, a common depot and several requests by the customers, find the set of routes with overall minimum route cost which service all the demands. Because of the fact that TSP is already a complex, namely an NP-complete problem, heuristic optimization algorithms, like genetic algorithms (GAs) need to take into account. The extension of classical GA tools for mTSP is not a trivial problem, it requires special, interpretable encoding to ensure efficiency. The aim of this paper is to review how genetic algorithms can be applied to solve these problems and propose a novel, easily interpretable representation based GA.},

These handover values are used in combination with a local GA involving no other agents, to decide what tasks to execute, and what tasks to leave to others. We compare the performance of our approach to a centralized version of GA, and a partly decentralized version of GA where computations are local, but all agents need complete information regarding all other agents, including position, range, battery, and local obstacle maps. We compare solution performance as well as messages sent for the three algorithms, and conclude that the proposed algorithms has a small decrease in performance, but a significant decrease in required communication.

	abstract = {The Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem (MTSP) is an NP-hard combinatorial and scheduling optimization problem defined in the following way: a company has to send salesmen to visit m cities. The company has n salesmen to distribute the cities between, and would like to plan out the sales routes in the cheapest way possible. Additionally, they would like to make sure that the salesmen have balanced schedules, since if there are 100 cities and one salesman is visiting 96 of them, the company’s customers in those 96 cities will be upset by the long time gaps between visits. We can immediately see then that there may be some conflict between minimizing the total cost, and minimizing the cost of the most expensive sales route. This problem is easily seen to be NP-hard by noting that for the specific case when 𝑛 = 1, the MTSP is the Traveling Salesman Problem, which is NPhard.},

However, many state-of-the-art heuristic approaches intended to specifically solve MTSP, do not obtain satisfactory solutions when considering an optimised workload balance. In this article, we propose a method specifically addressing workload balance, whilst minimising the overall travelling salesman’s distance. More specifically, we introduce the two phase heuristic algorithm (TPHA) for MTSP, which includes an improved version of the K-means algorithm by grouping the visited cities based on their locations based on specific capacity constraints. Secondly, a route planning algorithm is designed to assess the ideal route for each above sets. This is achieved via the genetic algorithm (GA), combined with the roulette wheel method with the elitist strategy in the design of the selection process. As part of the validation process, a mobile guide system for tourists based on the Baidu electronic map is discussed. In particular, the evaluation results demonstrate that TPHA achieves a better workload balance whilst minimising of the overall travelling distance, as well as a better performance in solving MTSP compared to the route planning algorithm solely based on GA.},

Scientific evaluations of this crime prevention technique have been undertaken for at least 40 years, with mixed results. One of the important questions to be answered regarding the implementation of a police patrol is the presence of crime displacement: criminal activity simply moving around the corner, away from the primary patrol area. Previous investigations of this phenomenon have found that, most often, crime displacement is nonexistent or less than crime reductions in the primary area of interest. In this article, we investigate local crime displacement. We use a spatial point pattern test that can identify changes in the spatial patterns/distribution of crime even if crime in all areas has decreased. We find moderate evidence for the presence of this spatial shift and discuss the implications.},

	abstract = {Originating with the Newark, NJ, foot patrol experiment, research has found police foot patrols improve community perception of the police and reduce fear of crime, but they are generally unable to reduce the incidence of crime. Previous tests of foot patrol have, however, suffered from statistical and measurement issues and have not fully explored the potential dynamics of deterrence within microspatial settings. In this article, we report on the efforts of more than 200 foot patrol officers during the summer of 2009 in Philadelphia. Geographic information systems (GIS) analysis was the basis for a randomized controlled trial of police effectiveness across 60 violent crime hotspots. The results identified a significant reduction in the level of treatment area violent crime after 12 weeks. A linear regression model with separate slopes fitted for treatment and control groups clarified the relationship even more. Even after accounting for natural regression to the mean, target areas in the top 40 percent on pretreatment violent crime counts had significantly less violent crime during the operational period. Target areas outperformed the control sites by 23 percent, resulting in a total net effect (once displacement was considered) of 53 violent crimes prevented. The results suggest that targeted foot patrols in violent crime hotspots can significantly reduce violent crime levels as long as a threshold level of violence exists initially. The findings contribute to a growing body of evidence on the contribution of hotspots and place-based policing to the reduction of crime, and especially violent crime, which is a significant public health threat in the United States. We suggest that intensive foot patrol efforts in violent hotspots may achieve deterrence at a microspatial level, primarily by increasing the certainty of disruption, apprehension, and arrest. The theoretical and practical implications for violence reduction are discussed.},

	abstract = {Research Summary The Kansas City Preventive Patrol Experiment (KCPPE) was seen by its developers to have produced “consistent evidence of the lack of effects of any consequence on crime,” a conclusion that was to have a strong impact on assumptions about police patrol for almost half a century. We identified the original official crime data from the KCPPE, and reanalyzed outcomes focusing on a comparison of the “proactive” versus “control” beats (“reactive beats” were criticized because of violations of treatment integrity); examining broad categories of crime (to increase statistical power); and using count regression models. Our findings are not unequivocal, but point to modest impacts of police patrol on crime in police beats. Policy Implications Our findings suggest that lessons drawn for half a century from the KCPPE need to be revisited. The KCPPE does not show that police patrol in large areas has no influence on crime, and this finding is consistent with several more recent studies. At the same time, we note that the effects of patrol in the KCPPE using our analysis strategy, and those found in other studies of preventive patrol in larger areas, are about half that found in hot spots policing studies. This suggests that police agencies ideally should invest in focused hot spots policing initiatives. However, absent an ability to manage such initiatives, or the crime analysis capabilities to identify crime hot spots routinely, simpler preventive patrol schemes to utilize uncommitted patrol time can be seen as potentially effective in preventing crime.},

In particular, given a set of targets and a set of supplemental targets corresponding to each target, the first stage decisions involve finding the sequence in which the vehicle has to visit the set of targets. Upon reaching each target, the UAV collects information and if the operator of the UAV deems that the information collected is not of sufficient fidelity, then the UAV has to visit all the supplemental targets corresponding to that target to collect additional information before proceeding to visit the next target. The problem is solved using a progressive hedging algorithm and extensive computational results corroborating the effectiveness of the proposed model and the solution methodology is presented.},

Relying on genetic algorithms, we encode patrol points and UAV launch/recovery points together to enhance the local search ability and convergence of the algorithm. Based on the real case of the D police station in Beijing, we explore the interactions among patrol elements and the impact on patrol tasks in different patrol environments. The results show that the Patrol missions formulated by Air-Ground Cooperative Patrol Optimization Model can be used to develop patrol tasks with better environmental adaptability. By analyzing the relationship between multiple groups of patrol elements, controlling the number of UAVs in future missions can improve the security of the area. And raise the ratio of hovering time in medium-risk areas to low-risk areas can improve the efficiency of patrols.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, a plethora of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) designs that significantly vary in size, shape, operating flight altitude, and flight range have been developed to provide multidimensional capabilities across a wide range of military and civil applications. In the field of forensic and police applications, drones are becoming increasingly used instead of helicopters to assist field officers to search for vulnerable missing persons or to target criminals in crime hotspots, and also to provide high-quality data for the documentation and reconstruction of the forensic scene or to facilitate evidence detection. This paper aims to examine the contribution of UAVs in real-time evidence detection in outdoor crime scene investigations. It should be highlighted that the project innovates by providing a quantitative comparative analysis of UAV-based and traditional search methods through the simulation of a crime scene investigation for evidence detection. The first experimental phase tested the usefulness of UAVs as a forensic detection tool by posing the dilemma of humans or drones. The second phase examined the ability of the drone to reproduce the obtained performance results in different terrains, while the third phase tested the accuracy in detection by subjecting the drone-recorded videos to computer vision techniques. The experimental results indicate that drone deployment in evidence detection can provide increased accuracy and speed of detection over a range of terrain types. Additionally, it was found that real-time object detection based on computer vision techniques could be the key enabler of drone-based investigations if interoperability between drones and these techniques is achieved.},

The inferences obtained from the images are transferred to the user with the artificial intelligence supported model created. In order to process these data, it was given as an introduction to the model created after preparation and the training of the model was provided. As a result of the training of the model, the images taken on the drone can be detected through the software developed with the support of real-time artificial intelligence.

Sensitivity analysis is conducted to study how simulation inputs affect performance measures. Evaluation of districting plans is compared between discrete-event and agent-based simulation. A response surface approach is developed to find optimal or sub-optimal districting plans to minimize average response time and workload variation. An iterative searching procedure based on experimental design is proposed to study the relationship between parameters in a redistricting algorithm and performance measures of districting plans. Latin hypercube design and central composite design are used for the discrete-event model. Experimental results show that districting plans generated by improved districting parameters have significantly better performances than randomly generated plans. Compared with an adjusted simulated annealing approach, the response surface method has better searching efficiency. Thus, good districting plans can be generated more efficiently with designed experiments and provide better alternatives for police departments. Similar procedure also works for agent-based simulations.},

Based on the actual patrol process, our model presents an overlapping patrol model and addresses patrol routing design and fleet allocation in a single integrated model. The objective is to minimize the overall average incident response time. Two strategies—overlapping patrol and non-overlapping patrol—are compared in our paper. Matrix encoding is applied in the genetic algorithm (GA), and to maintain population diversity and avoid premature convergence, a niche strategy is incorporated into the traditional genetic algorithm. Meanwhile, an elitist strategy is employed to speed up the convergence. Using numerical experiments conducted based on data from the Sioux Falls network, we clearly show that: overlapping patrol strategy is superior to non-overlapping patrol strategy; the GA outperforms the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm; and the computational efficiency can be improved when LINGO software is used to solve the problem of fleet allocation.},

	abstract = {As an efficient incident management program, freeway service patrol has gained wide popularity. There is increasing need for developing systematic procedures of planning the program to ensure efficient resource allocation and to achieve maximum benefits. A discrete event-based simulation model is developed to replicate the patrol process that includes districting, incident generation, response vehicle dispatching and routing, and incident clearance. Model validation proves its capability to accurately replicate the incident generation/distribution process. Later, the Interstate-95 freeway in south Florida is used as a model application example to test alternatives, and the improved alternative shows better performance compared with the previous even-length districting method and the currently used even-activity districting approach. Besides traditional roving scheme, the simulation model also has the capability to evaluate the prepositioning schemes. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the impact of operational parameter settings, such as beat districting, incident detection rate, and incident frequency. Although continuous efforts are needed to develop a more comprehensive simulation model for the freeway service patrol program, the application example presented in this study reveals promising application results, and provides an insight into the patrol process as well as a better understanding of the impact of parameters on performance.},
