	abstract = {Intelligent robot swarms are increasingly being explored as tools for search and rescue missions. Efficient path planning and robust communication networks are critical elements of completing missions. The focus of this research is to give unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) the ability to self-organize a mesh network that is optimized for area coverage. The UAVs will be able to read the communication strength between themselves and all the UAVs it is connected to using RSSI. The UAVs should be able to adjust their positioning closer to other UAVs if RSSI is below a threshold, and they should also maintain communication as a group if they move together along a search path. Our approach was to use Genetic Algorithms in a simulated environment to achieve multi-node exploration with emphasis on connectivity and swarm spread.},

	abstract = {As a novel urban delivery approach, the coordinated operation of a truck–drone pair has gained increasing popularity, where the truck takes a traveling salesman route and the drone launches from the truck to deliver packages to nearby customers. Previous studies have referred to this problem as the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FSTSP) and have proposed numerous algorithms to solve it. However, few studies have considered the stochasticity of the travel time on the road network, mainly caused by traffic congestion, harsh weather conditions, etc, which heavily impacts the speed of the truck, thus affecting the drone’s operations and overall delivery routine. In this study, we extend the FSTSP with stochastic travel times and formulate the problem into a Markov decision process (MDP). The model is solved using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms including the deep Q-network (DQN) and the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Using an artificially generated dataset that was widely accepted as benchmarks in the literature, we show that the reinforcement learning algorithms also perform well as approximate optimization algorithms, outperforming a mixed integer programming (MIP) model and a local search heuristic algorithm on the original FSTSP without the stochastic travel time. On the FSTSP with stochastic travel time, the reinforcement learning algorithms obtain flexible policies that make dynamic decisions based on different traffic conditions on the roads, saving up to 28.65\% on delivery time compared with the MIP model and a dynamic local search (DLS) algorithm. We also conduct a case study using real-time traffic data collected in a middle-sized city in the U.S. using Google Map API. Compared with a benchmark calculated by the DLS, the DRL approach saves 32.68\% total delivery time in the case study, showing great potential for future practical adoption.},

	abstract = {Natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes) can cause widespread power outages within distribution networks and interrupted power supply to critical loads (e.g., grocery stores, hospitals, gas, fire, and police stations) that provide utility services. Microgrids are localized power grids that can incorporate solar/photovoltaic (PV) distributed generators (PV-DGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) for stand-alone system operations independent of the main grid, known as the island mode. This study investigates a microgrid design problem using PV-DGs and ESSs when facing prolonged power outages in the main grid. We propose a multi-stage stochastic program that holistically considers the techno-economics of microgrid investment and daily operations by optimizing the reliability and resilience of the microgrid during a week-long power outage. The model is designed from a utility perspective that includes budget constraints for investment. Due to the large model size, we develop a nested L-shaped algorithm that solves the problem exactly and analyzes the microgrid’s reliability across different weather scenarios in the entire decision-making horizon. Results from a case study using real-world data show that an islanded utility-scale microgrid can effectively provide uninterrupted power supply to a network of 5 and 10 critical loads, covering 100\% and 97\% of the demand in all possible future scenarios, with potential investments of \$8 million and \$15 million, respectively.},

	abstract = {Natural disaster-prone locations can experience widespread power outages when the disasters cause large-scale damage to the existing power grid. Such damages can hinder a utility company’s ability to provide power to essential public resources (e.g., hospitals, grocery stores, fire, police and gas stations) of the utility’s serviced area. Backup generators, which provide power to these essential public resources during the outage, have limited capacities and can suffer from such failures as well. Microgrids, defined as localized power grids that can operate independent of the main grid, can help utilities provide disaster relief power supply to the essential public resources to improve their resiliency during the outage. This research investigates a multi-source capacitated facility location coverage problem (MS-CFLCP) that models a utility-owned microgrid that is operating independent of the main grid due to a large-scale main grid disturbance. The developed MS-CFLCP optimizes the location, sizing, assignment and the number of distributed generators (DGs) within the utility-owned microgrid, and aims to minimize the following total costs of the microgrid: (1) investment costs; (2) operation and maintenance costs; (3) distance traveled for power supply costs; (4) the unmet demand penalty costs; and (5) excess DG penetration penalty costs. The MS-CFLCP is solved with two-stage stochastic programming while considering the uncertainty in DG power output and essential resource demand. A budget constraint is included to capture practical financial considerations of the utility company when establishing the microgrid. We apply the model to a case study, using solar/photovoltaic-based DGs, to show its effectiveness and benefit to utilities.},

	abstract = {Vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) is an extension of classical vehicle routing, which involves the usage of trucks and drones. Nowadays, bushfires are taken into account as a major global challenging subject. Indeed, forests are very vulnerable to fires, and the classical patrol systems cannot patrol all areas of the forest and pastures due to the difficult crossing of some routes. The literature survey demonstrated that the mathematical models are an efficient approach for planning forest and rangeland patrols. Drones and trucks are used in cooperation for forest monitoring in this study, with drones acting as an efficient and accurate means of monitoring routes that are impassable to ground vehicles. However, this novel approach deals with several substantial challenges, including limitation in the drone's battery and the routing problem in an integrated truck-drone system based on considering hard-to-reach areas and creating a trade-off between time and cost of the patrol process. These issues make significant differences between the proposed novel approach and the classical vehicle routing problem. Thus, it is essential to develop a comprehensive approach to resolve these crucial issues. The present study develops a multi-objective mathematical programming model as mixed-integer programming for simultaneous patrolling of trucks and drones. The augmented epsilon constraint (AEC) method has been considered to solve the two-objective mathematical programming model. Besides, Benders' decomposition (BD) algorithm has been employed to evaluate the achieved results in large-size problems. The performance of the BD algorithm has been confirmed in this study. The findings indicated that the proposed model efficiently protected the forest via monitoring all areas, including impassable areas where ground patrolling is impossible (e.g., the lack of roads due to dense vegetation). Also, it was proved that this system was a novel, cost-effective patrol, which prevents uncontrollable fires in the shortest possible time.},

	abstract = {Multiple simple agents working together to achieve a common complex goal embodies the underlying theme of swarm concepts, with decentralized decision-making serving as the new frontier for tackling challenges associated with scalability, fault tolerance, and communication constraints. This paper builds on this emerging paradigm to develop a distributed approach (called PSOil) for off-shore oil spill mapping using a team of unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs. In-flight waypoint planning is achieved via a new particle swarm mechanics-inspired technique, employing a novel combination of anomaly detection for knowledge extraction, and a stochastic occupancy grid approach for timely processing and frugal sharing of knowledge (with net communications {\textless}1.7 KB/UAV every 10 waypoints). A total of ten real-world oil spill images, encapsulating complexities such as non-convex arbitrary shapes and disjointed segments, are studied in this work. Overall, the algorithm registered 55–90\% completeness in mapping oil-covered areas. PSOil required around one-third the time necessary for an exhaustive survey and was found to be superior compared to a typical random walk and a spiral search approach w.r.t. mapping performance and efficiency, respectively. Further tests simulating increasing UAV team sizes (to deal with larger search areas) and the random loss of team members respectively illustrate the scalability and fault-tolerance characteristics of PSOil.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have received much attention in the research and development community due to their strong potential in certain high-risk missions. In applications that involve multiple vehicles, the inter-vehicle communication and cooperation becomes a critical challenge to a successful mission. An effective co-operative control framework is required to co-ordinate the system-level decision making process and information flow among the multiple agents such that the collective mission is optimally achieved. In this paper, a cooperative control framework for a hierarchical UAV/UGV platform is proposed. A top-level mobile mission controller provides effective mission planning and system-level decision making such that mission completion time and resource expenditure are optimized. The mobile mission controller can monitor the dynamic environment with its own sensing capabilities and coordinate UAVs/UGVs in their actions. This paper discusses the potential application of the proposed hierarchical vehicle platform to high-risk missions, specifically in the context of wildfire fighting. The task generation and allocation problems and proposed approaches are presented under the given control framework.},

This system utilizes autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the main advantage of providing on-demand monitoring service faster than the current approaches of using satellite images, manned aircraft and remotely controlled drones. Furthermore, using autonomous drones facilitates minimizing human intervention in risky wildfire zones. In particular, to develop a fully autonomous system, we propose a distributed leader-follower coalition formation model to cluster a set of drones into multiple coalitions that collectively cover the designated monitoring field. The coalition leader is a drone \%with longer communication range that employs observer drones potentially with different sensing and imaging \%actuation capabilities to hover in circular paths and collect imagery information from the impacted areas. The objectives of the proposed system include i) to cover the entire fire zone with a minimum number of drones, and ii) to minimize the energy consumption and latency of the available drones to fly to the fire zone. Simulation results confirm that the performance of the proposed system -- without the need for inter-coalition communications -- approaches that of a centrally-optimized system.},
