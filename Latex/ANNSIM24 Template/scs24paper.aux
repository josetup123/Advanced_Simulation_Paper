\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces Stages Transfering: We illustrate the process of transitioning from the initial stage to the subsequent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model in a two-stage framework. Initially, our Neighboring approach strategically allocates the requisite number of fire stations to address the prevailing number of fire events in a given area. The fire stations surrounding each fire event are then clustered, constituting Stage two. In this stage, the individual fire stations and associated resources are treated as a unified entity. The DRL approach subsequently formulates a policy, determining the optimal actions for each fire event—whether to contain, extinguish, or withhold resource allocation—at discrete time intervals, starting at $t=0$. Visualized through three arrows, these actions represent the various states the agent (comprising a cluster of fire stations and resources) can assume during the second stage. Our temporal horizon spans 20 time steps, with each step equivalent to an hour in Anylogic units, providing a comprehensive representation of the evolving dynamics.\relax }}{6}{figure.caption.5}\protected@file@percent }

The actor loss leads policy modification to raise the likelihood of actions leading to better returns and decrease the likelihood of actions leading to lower returns. It is a component of the overall loss function, which combines actor and critic losses with the goal of maximizing the predicted cumulative reward by changing both the policy and value functions. \relax }}{6}{figure.caption.6}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces Critic Loss: In Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), the critic loss indicates the difference between the projected state value and the actual return seen during reinforcement learning training. The critic is in charge of estimating the state-value function, which calculates the predicted cumulative reward from a particular condition in A2C. The critic loss, which is frequently expressed as the mean squared error between the anticipated state value and the actual return, is a measure of how well the critic's predictions match the genuine rewards received in the environment.\relax }}{7}{figure.caption.7}\protected@file@percent }

To navigate the intricacies of the data, it is advisable to implement a state-action filter to prevent unnecessary traversal through events where fires have already been extinguished.

\@writefile{lot}{\contentsline {table}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces This table represents the results of various test events conducted to assess system performance. Five distinct tests were executed, systematically increasing the number of fire events to evaluate their impact on the overall system return. Notably, our analysis focused on a carefully selected cluster of data points. For this specific cluster, it became evident that exceeding eight fire events would likely surpass the capacity of the fire points cluster, inevitably leading to repercussions on the population. It is crucial to emphasize that the policies implemented during these tests are still in the developmental phase. Ongoing efforts are directed towards further refinement and completion in the subsequent stages of this research. These findings underscore the need for cautious consideration and ongoing optimization as we progress in the development of robust policies for managing fire events. \relax }}{8}{table.caption.10}\protected@file@percent }
